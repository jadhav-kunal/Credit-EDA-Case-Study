# Credit-EDA-Case-Study

This case study aims to apply EDA in a real business scenario. In this case study, we have applied techniques of Exploratory Data analysis. We have also developed a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understood how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/gauravduttakiit/loan-defaulter).
